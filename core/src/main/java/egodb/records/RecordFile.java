/**
 * A file which works as a heap of records.
 * <p>
 * This implementation has following properties:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>it supports variable size records, using block chaining</li>
 *     <li>updates are handled as deletes of previous versions and inserts of new record</li>
 *     <li>uses free-list to speed up inserts of new records</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * We have two types of blocks:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>card set, which holds bitset of free cards</li>
 *     <li>record set, which is set of records</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * How card set works?
 * <p>
 * Block is divided in n-byte cards, whenever we write we update bitset and mark occupied cards.
 * Whenever we delete record, we unmark freed cards.
 * <p>
 * Card sets are store every n record set, and hold free list for all subsequent record blocks.
 * <p>
 * For example for 4096 block size, card set block has following structure:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>byte header, which marks if this block is card set</li>
 *     <li>3-bytes of padding,</li>
 *     <li>4 bytes, to store bitset length</li>
 *     <li>remaining bytes are used as bit set which means we have available 4095*8 bits</li>
 * </ul>
 * (4096-8 (header size)) - gives us maximum size of bitset
 * (4088*8) gives us 32704 bits (cards)
 * if we assume bit card size of 64,
 * it gives us 511 blocks of records, so every 511 record blocks we will have single card set block
 * <p>
 * Records set blocks
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>4 bytes header, which marks if block is a card set</li>
 *     <li>set of records
 *          <ul>
 *              <li>first byte marks record type, it can be either RECORD, DELETED,OVERFLOW, NODE </li>
 *              <li>3-bytes padding</li>
 *              <li>if RECORD, next 4 bytes is length of record, and then we have record bytes</li>
 *              <li>if OVERFLOW, next 4 bytes are size of whole records, then 4 bytes which is number of nodes</li>
 *              <li>if NODE, next 4 bytes is size of node in bytes then number of bytes, then 4 bytes address of overflow record which is root of this chain</li>
 *          </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
